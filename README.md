## Problem Statement  
![Problems](images/Problems.png)  
With the rapid growth of e-commerce, university parcel collection systems remain largely manual and fragmented.  
### Across multiple Malaysian universities:  
- Notifications are sent via WhatsApp (individual or group-based)  
- Students must manually check Shopee or Lazada for delivery updates  
- Some parcels arrive without phone numbers  
- Students often use nicknames when ordering online  
- Late pickup penalties are applied even when notifications are missed  
### As a result:  
- Parcels become unmatched (“orphan parcels”)  
- Storage spaces become congested  
- Administrative workload increases  
- Students experience frustration and perceive the system as unfair  
- There is currently no centralized intelligent system to automate parcel logging, recipient matching, and notification delivery.
