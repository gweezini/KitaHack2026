## Problem Statement  
![Problems](images/Problems.png)  
With the rapid growth of e-commerce, university parcel collection systems remain largely manual and fragmented.  
### Across multiple Malaysian universities:  
- Notifications are sent via WhatsApp (individual or group-based)  
- Students must manually check Shopee or Lazada for delivery updates  
- Some parcels arrive without phone numbers  
- Students often use nicknames when ordering online  
- Late pickup penalties are applied even when notifications are missed  
### As a result:  
- Parcels become unmatched (“orphan parcels”)  
- Storage spaces become congested  
- Administrative workload increases  
- Students experience frustration and perceive the system as unfair  
- There is currently no centralized intelligent system to automate parcel logging, recipient matching, and notification delivery.

## Our Solution  
ParcelKita is a dual-sided AI-powered parcel management platform connecting Admins and Students.  
It:  
- Uses AI to extract structured data from shipping labels  
- Enables students to pre-register tracking numbers (Fast Track Claim)  
- Automatically matches anonymous parcels  
- Sends personalized AI notifications  
- Tracks overdue charges transparently  
- Synchronizes all updates in real-time

ParcelKita transforms manual campus logistics into a centralized intelligent system.  

## AI Integration  
ParcelKita meaningfully integrates Google AI technologies:  
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash  
- Google ML Kit 
- Gemini Text Generation  
AI directly automates data extraction, matching, and communication.

## Google Technology Utilization  
### Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Cloud AI)  
- We used Gemini Vision to convert messy, unstructured parcel labels into structured JSON data  
#### Effect:  
- Eliminates manual data entry  
- Reduces logging errors  
- Automatically extracts tracking ID, name, and phone number
